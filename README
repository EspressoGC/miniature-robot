[PUBLIC ALPHA 1]

BrainfuckXT is an extension to the Brainfuck programming language.
It keeps all of the original features and adds new ones.
BrainfuckXT is a compiled programming language targeting the .NET Framework by Microsoft (un-officially).
BrainfuckXT code is converted to C# code and is then compiled with KCSC.
Compiled executables can be run on all Windows systems with the .NET Framework installed.

You can read about the language at: http://esolangs.org/wiki/BrainfuckXT

This language's new features make it perfect for small applications and included applications.

Windows only. Requires .NET Framework v4.0+.
